1.3.2 - 2017-05-29
------------------------------------------------
* Replaces `gzip` with `zopfli` compression on Webpack build assets (up to 5% better compression)
* Adds `npm run build-browser` script, for generating just a production browser bundle

1.3.1 - 2017-05-28
------------------------------------------------
* Fixes #30 - code splitting now works on both the dev and production web server

1.3.0 - 2017-05-27
------------------------------------------------
## Linting
* Fixes #24 - ESLint works with latest Atom ESLinter, bypasses the need for Webpack and `babel-register`, and speeds up linting.
* Removes `kit/webpack/eslint.js` - which is now moot

## Server
* Closes #4 - Introduces server development bundling.  Now running `npm start` bundles _both_ a hot-reloading browser bundle, and a spawns server-side rendering that reloads upon code changes.
* Adds `distDev` route to paths, for server development bundled assets
* Adds `kit/webpack/server_dev.js` Webpack config for building and launching a development server
* Adds separate `kit/webpack/server_prod.js` Webpack config for building production server bundle
* Refactors `kit/entry/server.js` for working in both dev/production
* Adds console messages to show server start-up info, including network IP and ports
* Fixes `__dirname` in the built server bundle, so that `dist/server.js` can be run from anywhere (mentioned in / fixes https://github.com/reactql/cli/issues/36)

## Helpers
* Adds `kit/lib/console.js` and `logServerStarted()` function, for dumping neat console messages to the screen when starting servers
* Adds `kit/lib/routing.js`, with `<Status>` (internal), `<NotFound>` and `<Redirect>` components for handling status codes, 404s and redirects, universally.

## Webpack / bundling
* Adds ability to use multiple webpack-configs in a given config file, by exporting as an array
* Tidies up `kit/webpack/base` with common stats; fixes path typo
* Adds `kit/webpack/dev.js`, which is extended by server_dev and browser_dev and adds the correct env vars and source-maps.
* Closes #22 - Adds static bundling.  Now you can run `npm run build-static` to create a production browser bundle along with an `index.html` file, for uploading to a static web host
* Adds `npm run build-static-run`, for static bundling and running the static site locally on port 5000
* Adds `npm run static`, for running an already built static bundle
* Refactors `kit/webpack/browser_prod.js` to add console messages; fixes minor chunk hash typo
* Adds `css.getDevLoaders()` and `css.getExtractCSSLoaders()` helper functions to `kit/webpack/common.js`, for CSS configs that work across multiple configs
* Adds `stats` to `kit/webpack/common.js`, for a common output format that shows built assets, errors and warnings, with minimal clutter

"concurrently": "^3.4.0"
"serve": "^5.1.5"
"boxen": "^1.1.0",

  "promise-monofill": "^1.0.1"
* Re-orders packages so that they correctly appear within `devDependencies` or `dependencies`
* Refactors `npm run...` commands as follows:
  "browser": Runs hot-reloaded Webpack dev server for the browser on port 8080
  "build": Builds production bundles for server and browser
  "build-run": Builds production bundles, and runs a live web server
  "build-static": Builds a production browser bundle and `index.html`, for hosting statically
  "build-static-run": Builds static bundle, and runs it locally on port 5000
  "clean": Removes `dist` folder and contents
  "lint": Runs ESLint on project source code
  "server": Runs a previously build production web server
  "server-dev": Runs a development web server on port 8081 (restarts automatically on code changes)
  "start": Starts both a development web server and a hot-reloadable browser Webpack dev server (ports 8081/8080 respectively)
  "static": Starts a static web server on port 5000 for a previously built static bundle
  "test": Currently does nothing. TBD.

## App
* Adds 404 route handling (currently a blank response - but 404 codes can be implemented at the server level to be handled by middleware, or respond appropriately; redirects TBD.)

1.2.0 - 2017-05-22

* Moved `static/webpack.html` default page for the Webpack Dev Server to `kit/views/webpack.html`, to emphasise that `static` is userland
